# The Neo-Ecosystem
![Plop](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/f475cc4efe4d192c11c3e26c0ba72fc152a5a1fe.png)
With all these enchantments, the game might become too easy, right?
That’s why NeoEnchant+ isn’t just a pack—it’s an ecosystem introducing Yggdrasil and BeyondEnchant.

- **[Yggdrasil on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapack/yggdrasil-structure)** is a pack adding gigantic structures with unprecedented difficulty, unique rewards, and exclusive enchantments that you won’t find anywhere else. These structures make perfect use of the new enchantments, and the monsters have heard about them and won’t hesitate to use them against you.

- **[Beyond Enchant on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/datapack/beyondenchant)**, on the other hand, breaks the chains of vanilla limits. The levels of enchantments are increased, making them more powerful—the enchantments are more… well, you get the idea.

## Minecraft Realms - Problem
Experimental features, including enchantments, are not supported by Realms.
In addition, a bug exists in Realms that makes it impossible for mcfunctions to work.
To put it simply, the custom enchantments in this pack, or any other datapack adding enchantments, don't work on Realms.
