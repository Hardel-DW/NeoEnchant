# Features
**Propulsion:** Added several activation conditions for propulsion, which should improve the gameplay experience and comfort.
- No longer triggers in creative mode and in water
- Only triggers if there is a minimum of 5 blocks of air or equivalent such as flowers or other blocks below the player (#minecraft:replaceable).
- Requires 7 food points. It still only consumes 1.
- Pressing Sneak disables propulsion.

**Timber**: Small quality of life improvement.
- Sneak now disables the Timber effect exactly like other enchantments of the same type.
