# Overview
Hello everyone, I'm really excited to present version 5.13.0 of NeoEnchant. This update introduces a new enchantment for elytra and significantly improves enchantment accessibility with a major distribution overhaul.

NeoEnchant 5.13.0 achieves a major milestone: 100% of enchantments are now obtainable without additional content (except the three Yggdrasil-exclusive enchantments).

**This update is exclusive to Minecraft 1.21.11.**

# New Enchantments

## Propulsion
Transform your elytra flights into supersonic adventures! This enchantment gives you a directional speed boost mid-air when you press the jump button. Perfect for reaching distant locations faster while maintaining control.

**Max Level:** 3  
**Anvil Cost:** 1  
**Rarity:** Common

### Activation
Press and hold the jump button while flying to activate the boost. The enchantment only activates when flying below 35 blocks per second, preventing abuse at high speeds.

### Cost
Each boost consumes exhaustion based on level. Higher levels provide stronger boosts but drain more hunger. That consumes 1 hunger (Demi-hunger) per level.

| Level | Boost Strength | Exhaustion |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------- |
| I | x1.0 | 1 |
| II | x2.0 | 2 |
| III | x3.0 | 3 |

### Technical Details
- Requires player to be in flight mode (gliding with elytra)
- Only triggers when jump input is pressed
- Speed cap of 35 blocks per second prevents activation at high velocities

### Obtaining
Available through random loot chests across the world, in Asgard's ominous vaults and trial spawners (Yggdrasil addon), and in End City chests (Vanilla Structure addon).

### Enchanting Table
The following enchantments can now be found at enchanting tables:
- Death Touch
- Dimensional Hit

### Villager Trading
