## NeoEnchant v5.14.0 - Woe

Hello,

This release is part of a larger update cycle with:
- Yggdrasil 6.0.1
- NeoEnchant 5.14.0
- Whisper of Ether 0.2.0

### NeoEnchant

Vanaheim Seiors Oblivions is now available as a new reward enchantment from Vanaheim.

It makes the world bloom around you and is perfect for base decoration:
- bushes
- grass
- flowers

If Yggdrasil is not installed, this enchantment can still be obtained through fishing.

This update also includes multiple stability fixes.

### Yggdrasil 6.0.1

It includes:
- updates to 14 structures
- warning/error cleanup in console logs
- visual adjustments on selected structures

### Whisper of Ether 0.2.0

Changes include:
- better rendering for internal Waypoints
- Infuser no longer requires XP and now only ejects transformed runes (automation friendly)
- full translation coverage and multiple miscellaneous fixes

Have fun, and for players who prefer it, the mod version is also available.
